					Hemant Brijwasi, the 20-year-old Mathura boy, who won the second season of Colors’ “Rising Star” recently, says, it was his dedication and love for classical music that made him triumph in one more reality how. In 2009, he won the “Sa Re Ga Ma Pa L’il Champs”. An admirer of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Hemant wants to etch his voice in the hearts of listeners. His list of favourites includes Arijit Singh and A.R. Rahman. He maintains that if he will do hard work and his fans keep supporting, then soon he will be among the top singers of the country.

Excerpts:
<br>
How was your journey in the show?<br>

These were beautiful and golden moments of my life. Before the show, I mostly used to sing Sufi songs and had the mindset that I can sing only Sufi songs comfortably, but one day Shankar (Mahadevan) sir told me that I should try different types of songs and genres because my voice is versatile. After that I started trying different genres which proved to be a turning point in my journey. I gained a lot of confidence.<br>

Tell us about the role of your father, who also sings well.<br>

Thakur ji and my father’s blessings have made me the winner. My father is my guru and I have learnt everything from my father. I remember when I was a kid, he used to take me to local jagrans to learn singing. He motivated me to participate in reality shows. And my message to young singers is that love and respect your family. It is their blessings that will take you to your goal.<br>

What are your favourite memories of the show?<br>

My favourite memories are of fun that I had with my friends and judges. My bond was equally strong with contestants and judges. I remember one day Shankar sir was seating on his big chair and all of a sudden we made a voice and he got scared. He said nothing in response. He is sweet and encouraging and is like a father figure to me.<br>

How do you prepare yourself?<br>

I haven’t booked any time slot during the day to do riyaaz and sharpen my singing. I practise a lot, it does not matter where I am. I can do riyaaz anywhere – be it the airport, railway station or any other place. It is required to improve yourself continuously.<br>

What are your upcoming projects and what will you do with the prize money?<br>

I have sung the title song for ‘Soorma’, starring Diljit Dosanjh. It is written by Gulzar sahab and composed by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy. I will continue to do stage shows and will use the prize money to build a music studio.<br>
