				<h2 class="text-justify">Pakistani singer accuses actor Ali Zafar of sexual harassment</h2>
					<p class="text-justify">
					“It is not easy to speak out.. but it is harder to stay silent. My conscience will not allow it anymore #MeToo ,” she tweeted.<br>
A leading Pakistani singer-actor and a regular feature of the popular music show Coke Studio on Thursday accused actor and singer Ali Zafar of sexual harassment.
<br>
On Twitter, she wrote that by speaking out about her experience of sexual harassment she would “break the culture of silence that permeates through our society,” but did not specify when the incident happened.<br>

Ali Zafar rejected the allegations.<br>

“I have been subjected, on more than one occasion, to sexual harassment of a physical nature at the hands of a colleague from my industry: Ali Zafar. These incidences did not happen when I was young, or just entering the industry. This happened to me despite the fact that I am an empowered, accomplished woman who is known for speaking her mind! This happened to me as a mother of two children," she alleged in a one page note accompanying her tweet.<br>

The singer, who has acted in a couple of films,told Dawn.com that when the incident happened, the very first person she told was her husband. “After that I spoke about this incident to someone on my team, and one of my friends,” she said.<br>
'Intend to take this to court'<br>

Ali Zafar said he categorically denies all allegations against him. "I intend to take this through the courts of law and to address this professionally and seriously rather than to lodge any allegations here (Twitter), contesting personal vendettas on social media and, in turn, dis-respecting the movement, my family, the industry and my fans. Ultimately I am a strong believer that the truth prevails, always prevails," the actor said.<br>

In a statement, he also said that he is deeply aware and in support of the global #MeToo movement and what it stands for. "I am father of a young girl and a young boy, husband to a wife and son to a mother. I am a man who has stood up for myself, my family, my colleagues and friends countless times in the face of slander, defamation and general unkindness. I will do the same today. I have nothing to hide. Silence is absolutely not an option," he stated.
<br>
'I feel betrayed by his behaviour'<br>
Meanwhile, the singer who accused Mr. Zafar said that it has been an extremely traumatic experience for her and family.<br>

“It is not easy to speak out.. but it is harder to stay silent. My conscience will not allow it anymore #MeToo ,” she tweeted. "Ali is someone I have known for many years and someone who I have shared the stage with. I feel betrayed by his behaviour and his attitude and I know I am not alone.”<br>

She said it shouldn't’t be this difficult to speak out when one is in the right. “As parents, we tell our children to speak up if somebody touches them inappropriately and that it is never their fault. So why is it this hard to do the same? One shouldn't’t have to be this brave to report sexual misconduct. I’ve had support around me, I consider myself an empowered woman, and I still had such a hard time with this decision. By speaking up, I hope I’m able to break this chain of hesitation that holds us back from speaking up. I’m doing this not only for myself, but also for people who might be watching me, especially young women, who have the right to enter any professional or communal space without fearing harassment," she said.
<br>
The singer’s mother, a critically acclaimed Pakistani TV actor, said she supports her daughter's decision to speak publicly. However she said she is furious over the incident as a woman and also deeply hurt as a mother. “Previously, women were not even allowed to speak up about things like this. This has to stop. We need to tell our men this is not ok. No matter how minor or major harassment is, it leaves a scar. To heal this wound one has to talk about it,” she told Dawn.com.
<br>
In her note, the singer said that no woman is safe from sexual harassment. “In our society we hesitate to speak up and stay silent and this emboldens sexual harassment to flourish. We must collectively use our voices to share stories so that we break this culture of silence so that young woman of today are safer,” she stated.<br>
